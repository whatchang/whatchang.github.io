I am a freshman graduate student in AI at Gwangju Institute of science and technology. <br><br>
I'm very interested in AGI. I think studying AGI or developing AGI is helpful to answer that is "Is it possible to improve my intelligence?" or "Is it possible to inject my knowledge into others something?".  <br><br>
So, one of my life's goals is to answer these questions.
