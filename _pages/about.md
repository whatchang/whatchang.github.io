I am a freshman graduate student in AI at Gwangju Institute of science and technology. \\
I'm very interested in AGI. I think studying AGI or developing AGI is helpful to answer that is "Is it possible to improve my intelligence?" or "Is it possible to inject my knowledge into others something?".  \\
So, One of my life's goals is to answer these questions.
